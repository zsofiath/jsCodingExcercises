# jsCodingExcercises
In this repo I practice javascript with small coding exercises.
* Introduction
* Convert celsius to farenheit
* Fizzbuzz
* Factorial
* Reverse string
    > I tried to write recursion which switches the first and last letter while moving to the center of the string, but it did not work because of string immutability.
* Palindrome
    > String is a primitive in javascript, so it can easily be compared
* Longest word's length
* TitleCase
* Repeat string
* Is digit
* Get longest word
* Time validator
* Missing number
    > The javascript sort is an insertion sort
    > * It does not create new array


## Ideas
* Json key checker
* Number formatter (1000 -> 1 000)
* Sorting methods instead of the default sort
